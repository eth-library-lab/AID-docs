# Management Summary

AID is a digital library for machine learning models, currently being developed at ETH Library Lab. The objectives of the project are to provide a unified user interface for finding, downloading and using machine learning models. It has several components: 
* a website where users can search for machine learning models.
* a command line user interface for interacting with the library.
* a desktop application for accessing the downloaded resources.

The history of this project can be traced backed to 2019, when the project was started as a personal project with a limited number and types of computer vision models. The project was later extended to support user-defined models for different tasks (e.g. natural language processing). Between 2021 and 2022, AID was supported and incubated at ETH Library Lab. At ETH Library Lab, the developers and other contributors improved the project in many ways, including:

* Added GPU support and many more new features.
* Added a web user interface for interacting with downloaded resources.
* Redesigned the library interface.
* Communicated with the community in different ways, including video, blog post, and enriched documents.

The project is completely open source and can be found at its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/autoai-org/aid) and the fork in [ETH Library Lab GitHub](https://github.com/eth-library-lab/aid). Licensed under permissive Apache Licence, AID project allows for any use, including commercial use. We, as the developer team, provide a [centralized library service](https://hub.autoai.org) for users to search and download models. As of March 2021, there are 8 models in the library, including object detection, optical character recognition, speech-to-text and many more.
