# Background

In the past years, machine learning, especially neural networks and deep learning, has evolved into a powerful tool for many different tasks. Not only for traditional computer science tasks (e.g. computer vision, natural language processing), but also for other fields such as financial analysis, medical diagnosis, and so on. However, it is still a significant challenge to use machine learning algorithms. Especially for people without a machine learning background and numerous complaints can be found online about the difficulties of running machine learning algorithms, for example:

The fact that there are so many different open source machine learning libraries and frameworks complicates the issue further. Some of them have similar functionalities, but are implemented and used differently. For example, TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks for roughly the same purpose, but they are not compatible with each other. It makes the process of using machine learning algorithms even more difficult as the users will need to learn multiple machine learning frameworks if they want to use certain models.

To tackle these two challenges, the AID project aims to provide the following features:

* A website for conveniently searching, viewing and downloading machine learning models.
* A unified interface for installing and running these models.
