## Use Established Models

### Search for Models

Just like many other software stores, users start with a search bar where they can type in their interested keyword. Then our system will find models accordingly and list them below.

### Installing Models

After finding the desired models, users can then install it using the graphical user interface that we provide, as shown below:

This step can also be done in the command line interface with the following sub-steps:

*Step 1*: Download the source code and pretrained files

```
aid install {MODEL_URL}
```

*Step 2*: Build to Docker image and container

After installing the packages, users need to build it into an image which consists of all dependencies, pretrained model and source code. Users can then use ```aid build [vendor name]/[package name]/[solver name]``` to build image. Once finished, it will return a reference number for the built image. Users can check images by running ```aid list images```.

Once the image is built, users can start to create a corresponding container that bind the local IP to this image. This step is done by ```aid create [image ID] [port number]```. A container ID will be given if succeeded. You can also check the ID by ```aid list containers``` command.

### Access Models

To start the container, ```aid start [container ID]``` will help to deploy HTTP service to the specified port number. Now users can check if the container run on the port successfully by using aid list containers. If running properly, the status of Running will be ```TRUE```.

Then users can test the model by running ```aid infer [container ID] [argument]="content/path"``` and the solver will give the results. The help document (if given) will be displayed by running  ```aid help [package ID]```.

Users can also access and use the installed models with the built-in dashboard, as shown below:

By simply filling in the form, users can upload their requests to the solver and view the returned results.

### Interoperability with Docker

For advanced users, they can also operate the images and containers directly in the Docker CLI. For example, to start a container, users can run ```docker start [container ID]```. The ```imageID``` and ```containerID``` generated by AID project can be used directly as the ID in the Docker CLI.
